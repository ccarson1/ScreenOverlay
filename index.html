            0:01
          
      Hello friends!
            0:02
          
      With you Max and Sabrina.
            0:05
          
      Welcome to the channel for those who study Russian
            0:09
          
      !
            0:10
          
      For example, Sabrina is also studying Russian.
            0:13
          
      Quite a bit more, though.
            0:16
          
      Today I want to go with you to the park and take a walk.
            0:22
          
      Sabrina, please stay at home.
            0:25
          
      Unfortunately, I can’t take you now, but we will
            0:29
          
      definitely take a walk with you.
            0:32
          
      Agreed?
            0:33
          
      Yes?
            0:35
          
      So, friends, we are with you in Centenario Park.
      Centenario Park
            0:40
          
      This is a park located in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
            0:45
          
      And this park is a 20 minute walk from my
            0:52
          
      house.
            0:53
          
      Oh, funny!
            0:57
          
      There are parrots in the trees.
            1:01
          
      It's very, very funny.
            1:04
          
      You go, and just parrots scream.
            1:07
          
      For a person from Russia, this is very unusual.
            1:10
          
      And a parrot was sitting there on an oak tree.
            1:13
          
      Oak is a tree.
            1:14
          
      It looks like this.
            1:17
          
      And the parrot sat on the oak.
            1:19
          
      Well, I don’t know, a parrot on an oak tree for a Russian person is
            1:24
          
      like, it’s like a bear on a palm tree.
            1:28
          
      Or like, I don't know, a monkey on a Christmas tree.
            1:32
          
      Well, something like that, yes.
            1:34
          
      Something completely out of the ordinary.
            1:38
          
      I want to take a walk in this park with you today, show
            1:42
          
      this park.
            1:45
          
      Just to talk a little about what people are doing here.
            1:51
          
      Talk a little about my life.
            1:53
          
      In general, we will learn with you a few new words and expressions
            1:59
          
      in Russian, take a walk in the park.
            2:01
          
      I hope it will be just what you need on such a hot
            2:07
          
      day.
            2:08
          
      What absolutely amazes me is the flowering trees.
            2:15
          
      Blooming trees.
            2:17
          
      Here in Buenos Aires there are a huge number of trees that
            2:22
          
      are in bloom.
            2:23
          
      Well, it's very cool, because, firstly,
            2:27
          
      it's winter in Russia, and here it's summer.
            2:30
          
      But ok, I'm used to it.
            2:32
          
      But I'm not used to the fact that there are so many flowering
            2:37
          
      trees.
            2:38
          
      It's kind of hard to get used to this.
            2:42
          
      Because in Russia, for example, there are not so many trees
            2:46
          
      that bloom.
            2:48
          
      And here it is, by the way, araucaria.
            2:50
          
      Very, very cool tree.
            2:52
          
      There are many such trees in Patagonia.
            2:55
          
      This is a type of coniferous tree.
            2:59
          
      That is, they are somewhere near spruce and pine, but
            3:04
          
      they are very, very unusual, they look very beautiful.
            3:09
          
      I just love these trees!
            3:11
          
      Unfortunately, there are very few of them here in Buenos Aires.
            3:16
          
      But when I go to Patagonia, I will be able to see hundreds
            3:23
          
      and thousands of these trees!
            3:25
          
      Here they are.
            3:26
          
      Here they are too.
            3:28
          
      See?
            3:29
          
      Araucaria.
            3:30
          
      That's how interesting they are.
      Drinking fountains in Argentina
            3:31
          
      Oh, by the way!
            3:32
          
      And here is a drinking fountain, and you can drink water.
            3:35
          
      God!
            3:40
          
      On such a hot day, this is what you need.
            3:48
          
      I hope that in this, in this drinking fountain, the water was
            3:55
          
      drinkable.
            3:56
          
      I don't know.
            3:58
          
      Usually people drink from these fountains and everything is fine.
            4:02
          
      In Russia, by the way, this is a very rare occurrence.
            4:06
          
      Such drinking fountains.
            4:08
          
      Well, firstly, they are not so needed, because there is no such
            4:11
          
      heat.
            4:12
          
      And secondly, I don't know.
            4:15
          
      It's just not here.
            4:17
          
      Probably because they would freeze in winter.
            4:21
          
      It is cold in Russia for most of the year, and such fountains
            4:27
          
      are simply not needed.
            4:28
          
      And they would freeze.
      About dogs in Buenos Aires. Why am I afraid of dogs?
            4:30
          
      Dogs.
            4:33
          
      Hello dog!
            4:35
          
      In general, there are a lot of dogs in Buenos Aires.
            4:39
          
      This is the city of dogs.
            4:40
          
      I even heard about some statistics that Buenos Aires
            4:45
          
      is almost the first city in the world, either in terms of the number of
            4:52
          
      dogs, or the number of dogs per person.
            4:57
          
      In general, here is something like that.
            4:59
          
      But honestly, it's noticeable.
            5:02
          
      It's quite noticeable.
            5:03
          
      Because it's a weekday and there are very few
            5:10
          
      people here.
            5:11
          
      We can say that there are almost no people here.
            5:14
          
      But on the weekend there are a huge number of people
            5:17
          
      and a huge number of people with dogs.
            5:21
          
      So the Argentines are very fond of dogs.
            5:25
          
      There are huge fish here.
            5:27
          
      I don't know if we'll see one of them now.
            5:31
          
      But they are just gigantic!
            5:34
          
      Giant fish.
            5:35
          
      So.
            5:36
          
      By the way, why doves, doves are the same everywhere, friends?
            5:41
          
      I don't know.
            5:42
          
      The dove is some kind of universal bird.
            5:45
          
      In every country, the dove looks exactly the same.
            5:50
          
      Oh!
            5:51
          
      Here.
            5:52
          
      You see, there, I don’t know, is it visible or not visible?
            5:53
          
      There is an orange spot.
            5:55
          
      This is a huge fish.
            5:57
          
      Well, maybe we'll see those fish later.
            6:02
          
      This is a very pleasant, very beautiful park.
            6:07
          
      And I, of course, like to be here on a weekday.
            6:11
          
      Because, as I said, there are a lot
            6:17
          
      of people here on the weekends.
            6:22
          
      Some bushes are blooming.
            6:23
          
      I don't know what it is.
            6:26
          
      In general, I don't know.
            6:30
          
      90 percent of the trees and plants that
            6:35
          
      are here.
            6:36
          
      Oh Lord!
            6:37
          
      Phew!
            6:38
          
      This dog scared me.
            6:39
          
      She ran out of the bushes.
            6:44
          
      Like this.
            6:45
          
      And I got scared.
            6:46
          
      In general, I have a very bad experience with dogs, to be honest
            6:50
          
      .
            6:51
          
      As a child, I was bitten twice in a row by large dogs.
            6:59
          
      Just big dogs.
            7:02
          
      First my dog ​​and then my friend's dog.
            7:06
          
      Moreover, my friend's dog, she bit me like this.
            7:11
          
      I still have a scar here, and there
            7:16
          
      is a scar here too.
            7:17
          
      That's how she bit me.
            7:19
          
      This was really scary.
            7:20
          
      And then I developed dog phobia.
            7:24
          
      What is the correct name for this?
            7:26
          
      In general, yes, a phobia.
            7:27
          
      I was afraid of dogs.
            7:30
          
      When I saw the dog, I crossed to the other side
            7:34
          
      of the road.
            7:35
          
      Or, if I understood that I could not get around the dog,
            7:39
          
      then I simply went somewhere in the other direction.
            7:42
          
      Here.
            7:43
          
      And now I'm scared of the dog.
            7:46
          
      I think it's still that phobia.
            7:49
          
      Such is the remnants of the phobia that I had.
            7:54
          
      Because, well, it was a really big
            7:58
          
      trauma for me at the time.
      What do Argentines do in the park?
            8:02
          
      There are usually a lot of people here on weekends
            8:06
          
      .
            8:07
          
      And people here play sports, or dance, or
            8:13
          
      do yoga, or...
            8:17
          
      What else do they do?
            8:20
          
      They are engaged in some, I don’t know, some activities
            8:24
          
      that I can’t always understand.
            8:26
          
      For example, I saw a group of Kiss fans.
            8:32
          
      A group of Kiss fans.
            8:34
          
      Yes, such a group of people in Kiss T-shirts.
            8:37
          
      And they had a microphone and a speaker.
            8:41
          
      They probably wanted to do, arrange karaoke.
            8:46
          
      And sing karaoke, sing Kiss songs.
            8:50
          
      I don't know.
            8:51
          
      Well, that is, people of the same interests unite here and spend
            8:55
          
      some time.
            8:56
          
      This is where merchants usually sell various things.
            9:02
          
      For example, here, I don't remember.
            9:05
          
      Well, in general, like boiled corn or something else.
            9:10
          
      Popcorn, maybe.
            9:12
          
      In general, all in a row.
            9:14
          
      Everything is traded by people.
            9:17
          
      But now there is no one here at all.
            9:20
          
      It's so cool!
            9:22
          
      So, let's try to see what is written here.
            9:26
          
      So, May 14, 2019, Centenario Park.
            9:33
          
      Yeah, it was the 110th anniversary of the park.
            9:37
          
      Clear.
            9:38
          
      Because the park was founded in 1909.
            9:43
          
      And in 2019, the park turned 110 years old.
            9:49
          
      110 years?
            9:51
          
      Wait, is that like Bilbo Baggins?
            9:52
          
      No, Bilbo was, in my opinion, 111 years old.
            9:56
          
      Yes?
            9:57
          
      OK.
            9:58
          
      Oh, and here is just a party of parrots.
            10:03
          
      Let's try to capture them.
            10:05
          
      I don’t know, friends, about you, but for me, parrots
            10:09
          
      are something so exotic that I still can’t
            10:13
          
      believe that parrots just walk around here like that.
            10:19
          
      They eat grass and everything.
            10:22
          
      Moreover, such large parrots.
            10:24
          
      My parrot was about this size.
            10:27
          
      And these are huge.
            10:29
          
      Just huge!
            10:30
          
      And they just walk around like that.
            10:34
          
      And here is the international bird dove.
            10:39
          
      Which is practically the same in every country.
            10:44
          
      It doesn't matter if you're in the Northern Hemisphere or
            10:47
          
      the Southern Hemisphere.
            10:49
          
      Here is a playground.
      Are there places for children in Buenos Aires?
            10:52
          
      It's great that there are a lot of places in Buenos Aires that
            11:01
          
      involve spending time with your children.
            11:07
          
      Let me repeat this.
            11:08
          
      There are many different places in Buenos Aires where it is assumed
            11:15
          
      that you will come with children.
            11:17
          
      That is, places that are made for children.
            11:21
          
      Even here, look.
            11:23
          
      Something here, something here for the kids.
            11:26
          
      Yes, this is being done.
            11:27
          
      That is, children to participate in some kind of activity, to
            11:32
          
      do something interesting.
            11:34
          
      This is cool.
            11:35
          
      This is so cool.
            11:37
          
      In general, these are the things that I think should be.
            11:42
          
      If in the country or in the city.
            11:44
          
      Well, in the city, I guess.
            11:45
          
      If the city has a good infrastructure for
            11:49
          
      spending time with children, then I think
            11:53
          
      people will want to have children more.
            11:58
          
      Therefore, it is very important to create an infrastructure that
            12:03
          
      will make you feel good.
            12:07
          
      Feel comfortable in the city with a child.
            12:12
          
      For example, Yulia and I had a daughter,
            12:18
          
      Sabrina, born three weeks ago.
            12:21
          
      We have not yet been with her in this park, because it is quite
            12:25
          
      far away.
            12:26
          
      But I think that we will definitely come here.
            12:34
          
      In general, there are many parks in Buenos Aires.
      Which parks do I like?
            12:39
          
      However, I don't like all parks.
            12:43
          
      Well, I mean, I like parks with lots of trees,
            12:48
          
      water, and so on.
            12:50
          
      And many parks, they are like this, you know, there is a lot of concrete,
            12:55
          
      few trees.
            12:57
          
      These are the parks I don't like.
            13:02
          
      I am such a man, a man-nature.
            13:05
          
      I love nature very much.
            13:07
          
      And that's why I really love when there are...
            13:15
          
      When there are trees, when there are some green spaces.
            13:23
          
      Yes, that is the lawn.
            13:25
          
      By the way, many trees are exactly the same as
            13:29
          
      in Russia.
            13:30
          
      For example, here is a linden.
            13:32
          
      She has already blossomed.
            13:33
          
      Look, linden.
            13:35
          
      It's so cool to see familiar trees in
            13:40
          
      such an exotic country.
            13:43
          
      Yes, here is a linden.
            13:45
          
      But this, in my opinion, is called either ...
            13:47
          
      Or, damn it.
            13:49
          
      Sabia, tabia, tubia...
            13:51
          
      Ah, I don't remember the name of this tree.
            13:54
          
      But it is very cool.
            13:55
          
      Well, on this our walk is over, friends.
            14:03
          
      Please write why you love parks.
            14:06
          
      If you like parks of course.
            14:08
          
      It will be very interesting for me to read
            14:11
          
      what you wrote in the comments.
            14:13
